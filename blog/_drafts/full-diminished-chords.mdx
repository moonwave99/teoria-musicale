By stacking three _minor thirds_ one goes back to start, only one octave higher.
Since full diminished chords are made of the same interval, all their inversions are also a new FDC based on the new root (modulo enharnomics).

## B full diminished chord

<Sequence articulation="arpeggio">
  <Part notes="B D F Ab" label="B dim" octave={2}/>
  <Part notes="D F Ab Cb4" label="D dim"/>
  <Part notes="F Ab Cb4 Ebb" label="F dim"/>
  <Part notes="G# B D F" label="G# dim"/>
</Sequence>

One can respell everything as inversion of the first, in order not to have double flats / `Cb`:

<Sequence articulation="arpeggio">
  <Part notes="B D F Ab" label="B dim" octave={2}/>
  <Part notes="D F Ab B" label="D dim"/>
  <Part notes="F Ab B D" label="F dim"/>
  <Part notes="G# B D F" label="G# dim"/>
</Sequence>

## C full diminished chord

<Sequence articulation="arpeggio">
  <Part notes="C Eb Gb Bbb" label="C dim"/>
  <Part notes="D# F# A C" label="D# dim"/>
  <Part notes="F# A C Eb" label="F# dim"/>
  <Part notes="A C Eb Gb" label="A dim"/>
</Sequence>

Here the shape is easier to remember, it's white-black-black-white.
The permutations then go B-B-W-W and B-W-W-B.

## C# full diminished chord

<Sequence articulation="arpeggio">
  <Part notes="C# E G Bb" label="C# dim"/>
  <Part notes="E G Bb Db" label="E dim"/>
  <Part notes="G Bb Db Fb" label="G dim"/>
  <Part notes="A# C# E G" label="Bb dim"/>
</Sequence>

Permutations here: B-W-W-B, W-W-B-B, W-B-B-W.

## What have we learned

Practice runs of 2-3 octaves with all three arpeggios.
